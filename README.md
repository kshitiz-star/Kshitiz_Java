   - Stores student details
   - Methods:
     - `inputStudent()` → Takes input from user  
     - `calculateGrade()` → Calculates grade based on marks  
     - `displayStudent()` → Displays student details  

2. **Student Management System Class (`StudentManagementSystem`)**
   - Manages multiple students using an array
   - Methods:
     - `addStudent()` → Adds a new student  
     - `displayAllStudents()` → Displays all student records  

3. **Main Driver Class (`Main`)**
   - Provides a **menu-driven program** to interact with the system
   - Options:
     - `1. Add Student`  
     - `2. Display All Students`  
     - `3. Exit`
